# J-Dash Documentation

## Project Overview
J-Dash is a beautiful analytics dashboard for Jira designed specifically for CTO-level insights and real-time monitoring.

## Primary Purpose
Provide the CTO with real-time analytics about:
- Late tickets and items approaching deadlines
- Completion time analytics for different ticket types
- Frequency analysis of different ticket categories
- Performance metrics across teams and projects

## Main Ticket Categories
1. **Websites** - Website development and maintenance tickets
2. **Database Requests** - Database-related tickets and queries
3. **Weekly Report Requests** - Regular reporting and analytics tickets
4. **Bugs** - Bug fixes and issue resolution tickets

## Data Sources
- **Jira API** - Primary data source for ticket information
- **S:\Admin Cases** - Supporting documentation and case files
- **Real ticket data** - All tickets link to actual cases with detailed information

## Research Phase
This documentation will be built through extensive research of:
- Jira API structure and available fields
- Ticket categorization and workflow analysis
- Case folder structure and relationships
- CTO-specific analytics requirements
- Performance metrics and KPIs

## Next Steps
1. Analyze Jira API structure and available data
2. Study ticket categories and their characteristics
3. Map case folder structure to ticket data
4. Define CTO-specific analytics requirements
5. Design appropriate visualizations and metrics
