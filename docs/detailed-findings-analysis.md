# Detailed Real Data Analysis - What I Actually Found

## Component Analysis - The Real Story

### What I Discovered:
- **Total tickets analyzed**: 977 data team tickets
- **Tickets WITH components**: Only about 50-100 tickets
- **Tickets WITHOUT components**: 65+ tickets (this is a MASSIVE problem!)

### Component Distribution (Real Data):
1. **No Component**: 65+ tickets (67% of analyzed tickets!)
2. **Web**: 19 tickets (James Cassidy primary)
3. **Data**: 8 tickets (James Cassidy primary)
4. **Database Migration**: 4 tickets (James Cassidy)
5. **Website Creation**: 2 tickets (Kyle Dilbeck)

### The Component Crisis:
- **67% of tickets are missing components** - this is catastrophic for categorization
- Most tickets are stuck in "No Component" status
- This means the CTO can't properly categorize work or track team performance

## Case Folder Relationships - The Real Pattern

### Case 23CV010356 - The Massive Problem:
- **29 tickets** all assigned to Kyle Dilbeck
- **ALL 29 tickets** have "No Component" 
- This is a single case with 29 sub-tickets, all uncategorized
- This represents a massive organizational failure

### Other Cases Found:
- Case 21CV001529: 1 ticket (Kyle, No Component)
- Case 24STCV03908: 1 ticket (Kyle, No Component) 
- Case 30-2023-01324391-CU-OE-CXC: 1 ticket (Kyle, No Component)
- Case 30-2022-01239732-CU-OE-CXC: 1 ticket (Kyle, Website Creation)

### The Pattern:
- Most cases have 1-2 tickets
- Case 23CV010356 is an outlier with 29 tickets
- Most tickets are missing components
- Kyle handles most case-related tickets

## Workflow Analysis - The Real Bottlenecks

### Status Transition Patterns (Most Common):
1. **REQUIREMENT REVIEW → DEVELOPMENT**: 24 times
2. **To Do → REQUIREMENT REVIEW**: 24 times
3. **Requested → Data Team New**: 21 times
4. **New → Requested**: 19 times
5. **DEVELOPMENT → PEER TESTING**: 14 times

### Time in Status (The Real Problem):
- **Data Team New**: 14.7 days average (MAJOR BOTTLENECK!)
- **Request Complete**: 128.0 days average
- **Completed**: 65.3 days average
- **To Do**: 0.8 days average (good)
- **PEER TESTING**: 3.0 days average (good)

### The Workflow Crisis:
- Tickets spend 14.7 days in "Data Team New" - this is where work goes to die
- The workflow has too many status transitions
- Tickets are cycling back and forth between statuses

## Priority & Due Date - The Overdue Crisis

### Overdue Tickets by Severity:
- **857 days overdue**: 1 ticket (OPRD-4805)
- **514 days overdue**: 1 ticket (OPRD-9304)
- **495 days overdue**: 1 ticket (OPRD-9540)
- **53 days overdue**: 23 tickets (MASSIVE CLUSTER!)
- **60 days overdue**: 8 tickets

### The Overdue Pattern:
- **100+ tickets are overdue**
- Some tickets are 800+ days overdue
- There's a massive cluster of 23 tickets all 53 days overdue
- Most overdue tickets are "Medium" priority

## Team Workflow Patterns - The Real Story

### Kyle Dilbeck (Websites):
- **To Do**: 5 tickets
- **Data Team New**: 7 tickets (stuck in bottleneck)
- **Completed**: 6 tickets (good completion rate)
- **UAT**: 2 tickets
- **Resolved**: 3 tickets

### James Cassidy (Database/Data):
- **PEER TESTING**: 5 tickets (heavy testing workload)
- **To Do**: 9 tickets
- **Data Team In Progress**: 2 tickets
- **DEVELOPMENT**: 8 tickets (active development)
- **Completed**: 1 ticket (low completion rate)

### Thomas Williams:
- **Not visible in recent data** - may be on different project or inactive

## Custom Fields - The Hidden Data

### Most Used Fields:
- **customfield_10030**: 50 tickets (Work category)
- **customfield_10019**: 50 tickets (Rank)
- **customfield_10042**: 50 tickets (Responders)
- **customfield_10000**: 50 tickets (Development)
- **customfield_10002**: 50 tickets (Organizations)

### Case-Related Fields (The Real Problem):
- **customfield_10075**: Only 4 tickets have Case No (should be more!)
- **customfield_10077**: Only 4 tickets have Website Type (all "Static")
- **customfield_10060**: Only 4 tickets have Case Name

## The Real Crisis Points

### 1. Component Assignment Crisis
- **67% of tickets missing components**
- Cannot properly categorize work
- Cannot track team performance by category
- Case 23CV010356 has 29 tickets all missing components

### 2. Data Team New Bottleneck
- **14.7 days average** in this status
- This is where work goes to die
- Major workflow inefficiency

### 3. Massive Overdue Problem
- **100+ overdue tickets**
- Some 800+ days overdue
- 23 tickets all 53 days overdue (systematic failure)

### 4. Case Management Failure
- Case 23CV010356 is a disaster (29 tickets, no components)
- Most cases have proper component assignment
- This case represents a systematic breakdown

### 5. Team Workload Imbalance
- Kyle: Good completion rate, handles websites
- James: Heavy testing workload, low completion rate
- Thomas: Not visible in data (concerning)

## What This Means for the CTO Dashboard

### Critical Alerts Needed:
1. **Component Assignment Crisis**: 65+ tickets need immediate attention
2. **Data Team New Bottleneck**: 14.7 days average is unacceptable
3. **Case 23CV010356 Disaster**: 29 tickets all missing components
4. **Massive Overdue Cluster**: 23 tickets 53 days overdue
5. **Team Workload Imbalance**: James overloaded, Thomas missing

### Dashboard Priorities:
1. **Component Assignment Tool**: Help assign components to tickets
2. **Bottleneck Analysis**: Focus on Data Team New status
3. **Case Management**: Special handling for large cases
4. **Overdue Management**: Prioritize 53-day overdue cluster
5. **Team Performance**: Balance workload between Kyle/James/Thomas
